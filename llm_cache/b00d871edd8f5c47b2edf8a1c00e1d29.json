Policy Overview**  \n**Policy Name and Issuing Authority**  \n- **Policy Name**: *Policy on Adoption of Open Source Software for Government of India*  \n- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Communication & Information Technology, Department of Electronics & Information Technology (DeitY).  \n\n**Objectives and Scope**  \n- **Objectives**:  \n  - Promote adoption of Open Source Software (OSS) in e-Governance systems.  \n  - Reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and ensure strategic control over digital infrastructure.  \n  - Align with the Digital India program’s goals of efficiency, transparency, and affordability.  \n- **Scope**:  \n  - Applies to all Central Government organizations and State Governments that adopt the policy.  \n  - Covers **new e-Governance applications**, **new versions of legacy systems**, and **e-Governance upgrades**.  \n\n**Target Beneficiaries**  \n- **Primary**: Government organizations (Ministries, Departments, statutory bodies, etc.) implementing e-Governance projects.  \n- **Secondary**: Citizens, through improved access to affordable, transparent, and reliable digital services.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Key Provisions**  \n**Main Features and Benefits**  \n- **Mandatory OSS Preference**: OSS is the *preferred option* over Closed Source Software (CSS) for e-Governance systems.  \n- **Supplier Requirements**:  \n  - All RFPs must include a clause requiring suppliers to propose OSS solutions.  \n  - Suppliers must justify exclusion of OSS in their bids.  \n- **Exception Clause**:  \n  - Permits CSS adoption in specialized domains where OSS solutions are unavailable, urgent needs exist, or expertise is lacking.  \n- **Support Mechanisms**:  \n  - Institutional frameworks, partnerships with industry/academia, and collaboration with global OSS communities.  \n\n**Eligibility Criteria**  \n- **Applicable to**:  \n  - Central Government organizations.  \n  - State Governments that voluntarily adopt the policy.  \n- **Exclusions**:  \n  - Government organizations offering *commercial services* are excluded.  \n\n**Implementation Mechanism**  \n- **Policy Framework**: GoI will publish a framework prioritizing application areas and recommending OSS stacks.  \n- **RFP Compliance**: Mandatory inclusion of OSS consideration in all e-Governance project RFPs.  \n- **Decision Criteria**: Evaluation of OSS vs. CSS based on capability, strategic control, scalability, security, lifetime costs, and support.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Implementation Framework**  \n**Timeline and Phases**  \n- **No Explicit Timeline**: The document does not specify phased implementation or deadlines.  \n- **Review Clause**: The policy can be reviewed and updated as needed by GoI.  \n\n**Responsible Agencies**  \n- **Central Authority**: Ministry of Communication & Information Technology, Department of Electronics & Information Technology (DeitY).  \n- **Point of Contact**: JS (e-Governance), DeitY (jsegov@deity.gov.in).  \n\n**Budget Allocation**  \n- **Not Specified**: The document does not mention budgetary allocations for OSS adoption or support mechanisms.  \n\n---\n\n#### **4. Impact Assessment**  \n**Expected Outcomes**  \n- **Cost Reduction**: Lower TCO through free OSS licenses and reduced dependency on proprietary software.  \n- **Strategic Control**: Enhanced flexibility and customization in e-Governance systems.  \n- **Digital Empowerment**: Alignment with Digital India’s vision of affordable, accessible, and transparent services.  \n\n**Beneficiary Coverage**  \n- **Direct**: All Central Government e-Governance projects and State Governments adopting the policy.  \n- **Indirect**: Citizens via improved digital service delivery and reduced taxpayer expenditure.  \n\n**Social and Economic Impact**  \n- **Social**:  \n  - Increased transparency and accountability in public services.  \n  - Encouragement of local OSS development and innovation.  \n- **Economic**:  \n  - Reduced software procurement costs for the government.  \n  - Potential growth of India’s OSS ecosystem through partnerships and contributions.  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Challenges and Recommendations**  \n**Potential Implementation Challenges**  \n1. **Technical Expertise Gaps**: Lack of skilled personnel to implement and maintain OSS solutions.  \n2. **Resistance from CSS Vendors**: Pushback from proprietary software providers.  \n3. **Legacy System Integration**: Difficulties in migrating or upgrading legacy systems to OSS.  \n4. **Ambiguity in Exceptions**: Risk of misuse of the exception clause for non-justified CSS adoption.  \n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**  \n1. **Capacity Building**:  \n   - Establish training programs for government officials and IT staff on OSS technologies.  \n   - Collaborate with academia to integrate OSS education into curricula.  \n2. **Clear Guidelines for Exceptions**:  \n   - Define standardized criteria and approval processes for CSS exceptions to prevent misuse.  \n3. **Incentivize OSS Adoption**:  \n   - Offer tax benefits or subsidies to organizations transitioning to OSS.  \n4. **Public-Private Partnerships**:  \n   - Leverage industry partnerships to develop OSS solutions tailored to Indian e-Governance needs.  \n5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**:  \n   - Create a dedicated oversight body to track compliance and assess policy effectiveness.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe policy represents a strategic shift toward cost-effective, sustainable, and transparent digital governance. While its mandatory OSS preference aligns with global trends, successful implementation hinges on addressing technical, institutional, and cultural barriers. Strengthening support mechanisms and ensuring accountability in exceptions will be critical to achieving its objectives.",
