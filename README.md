## 📌 Summary

Public policies and government documents are often lengthy, jargon-filled, and difficult to interpret. SmartPolicy ThinkTank bridges this gap by offering AI-driven summarization and keyword extraction — helping users understand what really matters in a document within minutes.

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

Smart Policy Think Tank is specifically designed to simplify and summarize government policies. While it may work on other types of PDFs, its full potential and intended accuracy are best realized when used for government policy documents.
